# What
A webserver in c that does not have good error handling (shocker)
Does not utlize SSL (yet)

# Features
- Only displays a singular index.html as of now
- Multithreaded client connections

# Planned Features
- Adding SSL (doesn't make a difference , I know)
- Serve full folder structures to allow for links in html files (this also adds css and js support)

# Never Planned
- Usage on a production environment (seriously this is made for fun)
- Actual server code
